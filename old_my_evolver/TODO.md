## TO DO:
1. add edges to give structural information
  1.1 refine should retain constraint information
2. average vertex location on a face / distance  from each other
3. update visualize to ensure connectivity with edges
4. interactive optimization
5. input file can also adjust coefficients, with default values:
  5.1 constraints - volume
  5.2 gradient descent - step
  5.3 gaussian modulus
  5.4 bend modulus
